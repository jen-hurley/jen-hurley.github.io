          <h2> Command Line Primer</h2>
          
            <h3>In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            The command line is just another method to navagate and use your computer. You can think of it like your computer without it's skin, where the skin is the G.U.I (Graphical User Interface) which is what makes it look pretty and more appealing with visual prompts, like app icons. 
          </p>
      
            <h3>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            No. Partly this was because I was hand writting a lot of notes to help me retain information. Now I'm not sure that hand writting notes is so necessary because the all the information I need is readily available to me. I'm going to try out not writing so many notes, and I'll pay more attention to the timebox suggestions in the future and set timers for myself.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.</h3>
        
            <ul class="blog-post">
            <li>ls = lists all visable files in the directory, ls -a = list all files including the hidden ones!</li>
            <li>mkdir "new-folder" = make a directory(folder) called "new-folder"</li>
            <li>touch "new-doc.txt" = make a new .txt file called "new-doc"</li>
            <li>cp filename.txt new-folder = copy the document "filename.txt" to the folder "new-folder"</li>
            <li>open . a-"application name" will open a file in "application name"</li>
            </ul>
          

            <h3>Did you learn anything unexpected?</h3>
            <p class="blog-post">
              I wasn't expecting to get the hang of using the command line so easily! It can be quite a repeditive process to navagate around, so that helped to solidify some basic commands into my brain.

              <h2> Version Control with Git </h2>

            <h3>What's the difference between git and GitHub?</h3>
              <p class="blog-post">
                Git is a Distributed Version Control System software, whereas Github is website that runs Git. Git is the software, and Github is a Hub (or online space) where you can use that software. 
                </p>
            
              <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</h3>
              <p class="blog-post">
                If Git is your filing system, then Github would be your filing cabnet with all your separate folders in there and ready to go. 
                </p>

              <h3>Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?</h3>
                <p class="blog-post">
                  Yes!
              </p>

                    <h2> Install and Explore Git </h2>
              <h3>What is a Git workflow?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                 A Git workflow is a recommended squencial process for managing projects (repositories) that you're working on so that changes and additions can be consitantly and efficiently merged to and recorded in the remote repository (working version of a project) from your local repository (working directory, where you're working on your project).
                </p>
                <h3>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    I learnt it is helpful for me to hand write notes, but that I can be selective about which notes to write instead of EVERYTHING. Whenever I was confused I would Google the issue and find an explaination that made more sense to me. If i was blocked it was usually a typo on my part. 
                </p>
                <h3>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    Hand write the squences in my notebook. I got put off handwritting notes today because I thought it might be a waste of my time, but I do know it helps me stay engaged and retain info.

                  <h2> Track and Commit</h2>
            <h3>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</h3>
                <p class="blog-post">
                  Say you're collaborating on a project with multiple people. You've finished doing some work on your part of the project and you want to merge it into the Master version of the project.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Staging is essentially the process of getting your files organised and ready to be moved to the Repository (you can think of a Repository as a "Master Project" folder).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  It's similar to the process of compiling files into a separate folder before moving them into the Master Project folder so that you're not just dumping a bunch of unorganised files into the Master Project folder. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  When you are Committing you are moving those files from your compiled folder into that Master Project folder. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Breaking up the process into separate states of Staging and then Committing allows you to make any changes or add/remove documents from your folder before you moving them into that Master Project folder. For each time you do stage and commit process it's like you're making a separate folder of those particular changes/additions, which gives you the ability to record and go back to each set of changes or additions you made. 
                </p>

        <h2> Branch, Pull, Merge</h2>
  <h3>What is main?</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
       The main is the master (and ideally fully working) version of the project
      </p>

      <h3>Why create a Branch?</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        Branches are for testing out new features/code before including it in the main version without effecting the main. This means you can also have your feature/new code reviewed before merging it to the main incase there are errors in your code, so that you don't accidentally break the main. 

      </p>

      <h3>Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand? </h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        Inituitive
      </p>

<div class="about-me-post">
  <h2> GitHub Fork & Clone</h2>
    <h3>What are some examples of when you would fork?</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
      You would fork a project that belongs to someone else that you don't have permissions to alter or add to, meaning that you could try some stuff out without altering anything in the main repository and then propose it to the author who can decide whether or not they want to include it in the main.   
      </p> 

    <h3>Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked? </h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
    Yes! It click when I understood the purpose of forking as opposed to branching, particularily when it comes to open source projects. 
    </p>

  <h2> Setup Repo & Create Blog</h2>
    <h3>Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        I felt a little nervous about branching. I wanted to REALLY make sure I didn't override anything on the main. If anything, it felt a bit overhwleming having to do all the stages of Git, but I understand the necessity of them.
      </p> 

    <h3>If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions? </h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
    Coming from a background in administration I imagined that people would just use a Dropbox equivalent for working on projects. I imagined the work all to be done in one place that people could collabrorate one, like GoogleDocs.

  <h2> Thinking like a programmer</h2>
    <h3>What is your process so far for solving problems?</h3>
    <ul class="blog-post">
      <li>Figure out exactly what it is that need to be achieved. </li>
      <li>Break it down into separate parts or steps.</li>
      <li>Understand each part of the problem and research the problem areas to get a deeper understanding of what's going on. </li>
      <li>Make a plan on how to work through each part.</li>
      <li>Work on each part until it's resolved.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Have a look at what the internet says on how to think like a programmer. What patterns do you see? What do you notice? </h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
      To think like a programmer is to have the ability to effeciently solve problems by breaking them down and looking at them from different perspectives to find solutions. It's about approaching problems in a logical manner. I notice a lot of amphasis on persistence and taking a step back when you get overwhelmed, so that you can come back to the problem from a calmer place. I think having this ability is useful in all areas of life. It's a mindset that's based on growth and persiverance.
    </p>

    <h3>What does the internet say about flipped learning? What is flipped learning and flipped classroom? How do you think it will relate to your learning journey?</h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Flipped Classroom is when students are provide the course information/materials to be studied outside of the classroom which leaves class time available for applied learning of the course materials and teacher assistance. I think it is going to be particularly helpful for me to be able to go back over information as often as I need in my own time to be able to understand the concept. The flexibility around when and how the course material is learnt is a lot more accessible to me when the basic learning is pre-provided outside of class and then used in a pratical sense during assignments.

      <h2> Introduce yourself</h2>
        <h3> What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? </h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            SCARY! But I'm glad I did it because I want to develop my self confidence, and it's great that I get to practice doing that in an environment where I feel safer and my comfortable than I usually would. 
          </p> 
    
        <h3>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?  </h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
          I was very self conscious! I don't like much attention or talking about myself, so it's something I wouldn't really do on my own accord.
