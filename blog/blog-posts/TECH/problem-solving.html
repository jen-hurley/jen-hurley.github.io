          <h2> TECH POST 4: <br> PROBLEM SOLVING </h2>
            <span> A time when I ... was blocked on a simple problem </span>
            <p>
            I was getting frustrated at one of the challenges because I hadn't been taking breaks so I was really tired. I knew that I was really close to the solution, but I kept going around in circles. I chose to stop and take a break because it got to a point where NOTHING was making sense to me and I was starting to get upset. I put it away and had some food. And, to my surprise, when I came back to it I could see exactly what I was missing! (It was to do with dot vs bracket notation and I was using dot notatition in a place where I should have used a bracket) (Also I need to take more breaks!!!)
            </p>

            <span> A time when I ...  elegantly solved a problem </span>
            <p>

            When I was doing the capitalize challenge, I had broken the problem down into steps, and I was looking online for ways to get the solution for each part. A lot of the solutions used a =>, which made me a lil confused about what was happening in the function. So, I then looked up how the => works and then worked my way through laying comments to myself for the function out in a way I could understand. 
              
            </p>

            <span> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</span>
            <p>

            Pseudocode: quite confident - I think when I start to understand more about what specific steps I need to do to get the result this will be a great method for me.
            <br>
            <br>
            Trying something: one of my go to methods! Though when I'm tired/stressed this is not the most useful...
            <br>
            <br>
            Rubber ducky method: I'd like to practice this more to get a deeper understanding of what I'm doing, and to get better at teaching/explaining things. I think I'll try using this on my cats!
            <br>
            <br>
            Reading error messages: I've wrapped my head around parts of this. It does help me spot when I've done things like not define a function, but sometimes I don't understand what the error is. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Console.logging: I've just learnt how to do this from vs code! I'll be using this more from now on because I think it'll be clearer to me than the error messages.
            <br>
            <br>
            Googling: My first go to! If I am struggling to understand a written explanation, I then go to youtube/find a video that shows the process
            <br>
            <br>
            Asking your peers for help: something I avoid. I have asked my friend who's not in this course for help, but at the moment I'm too shy/embarrassed to ask for help from my classmates (I want to be able to feel comfortable to do this!)
            <br>
            <br>
            Asking coaches for help: same as above, though I also haven't felt the need. If anything, I've thought about asking for help interms of things like "what to do if you feel burn out is imminent, but are too affraid of getting behind to stop working"
            <br>
            <br>
            Improving your process with reflection: this I do a lot. espically if I find the answer to something, but don't fully understand stand what is going on. I'll write as comments to myself what each bit of the code is doing. 

            </p>

            
            <span> Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</span>
            <p>

            What makes me reluctant to ask for help is when I feel like I'm behind in the course work. I worry that people are already WAY ahead of me and feel that it would be embarrising to show that I'm still working on something they finished a day or two ago. In saying that, when I've helped people with challenges I'd completed it made me feel really good and I was very happy to help them. I'm sure others would feel the same, but I haven't quite gotten over that for myself yet.
