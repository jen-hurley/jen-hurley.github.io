      <h2> TECH POST 1</h2>
      <span> What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</span>
      <p>
        Classes and ids are both selectors used for styling elements, so let's start by differentiating between a "class" and and "id"!
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of your webpage as a school with a whole bunch of students and teachers, where the students and teachers are the elements on our webpage.
      </p>

      <p>

        There's no such thing as student individuality at this school, so we're going to make all the students wear a uniform.
        <br>
        <br>
        We can group all the students together and style them in their uniforms with class='student-uniform' and they take on the attritbutes of "student" whilst wearing their uniforms.
        </p>
        <p>
        The teachers are however very unique and special because each of them teach different subjects.
        <br>
        <br>
        We can give each subject teacher their own unique id with id='science.teacher' and id='art.teacher'
        </p>
        <p>
        Now we know exactly who the science teacher is and who the art teacher is becuase of their ids - the science teacher is wearing a labcoat and the art teacher is wearing paint-covered overalls. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Only the science teacher is allowed to wear a labcoat, and only the art teacher can wear paint-covered overalls.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, we can also strip the teachers of some of their indivuality, and apply class styling selectors to the all the teachers along with their specific ids by applying class='moderate-dresscode'. 
        </p>

       <p>

        So, how to use them?
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Class</u>: type of element <em>ie. a student or a teacher</em>
        <br>
        <br>
        Should be used when you want to consistantly style elements across a page or site.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>~You can style multiple elements with class="main-text" in HTML and .main-text in your CSS~ </em>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>id</u>: unique element <em>ie. science-teacher</em>
        <br>
        <br>
        Should only be used for one instance on a page like the header, the footer, or a navigation bar.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>~You can style a single element with id="header" in HTML and #header in your CSS~ </em>
       </p>
        <p>

        TIP: you can use ids to jump to specific sections on your webpage using an anchor tag! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Like this: < a href="#science-teacher" >< Jump to Science Teacher >

      <span> What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks? </span>
      <p>
        When refering to displaying "inline" or as "inline blocks" we're talking about how we're displaying inline elements. 
        </p>
      <p>
        An inline element is an element that will not break a line of text that it's in. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This is opposed to a block element, which will always start on a new line and take up the full width that's available to it.
      <p>
      Some examples of an inline element would be an image, a link, or the span element. 
      </p>
        
      <p>
      The difference between inline and inline-block display is that we can adjust the width and height values of our inline elements when we display them as "inline-blocks".
      <br>
      <br>
        When we display our inline element with "display: inline" we aren't able to adjust our width and height values of that element.
        </p>
        <p>
        If we use "display: inline" our elements inside the purple container we're not able to adjust width and height values. 
        <img src="https://jen-hurley.github.io/images/display-inline-example.png">
        <p>
        BUT, if we use "display: inline-block", we can set the height and width values of each element in the line. 
        <img src="https://jen-hurley.github.io/images/display-inline-block-example.png">
      </p>

      <p>
        Below is another example of the effect the display has on the height and width values. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I've set the height and width values of both span elements, but the values are only being applied to the span class with the display of "inline-block".
        <br>
        <img src="https://jen-hurley.github.io/images/tech-code-example-inline.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        Here's is a paragraph of text with our <span class= inline-span> span elements. </span> <span class= inline-span> Our span elements are inside these borders </span> being displayed as "inline"<span class= inline-span> like this.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Here's is a paragraph of text with our Here's is a paragraph of text with our <span class= inline-block-span> span elements. </span> <span class= inline-block-span> Our span elements are </span> now being displayed as "inline-blocks"<span class= inline-block-span> like this.</span>
        <br>
        <br> 
        If you play around with the size of your browser window you can also see the effect it has when the paragraphs wrap as the main body container size changes!
