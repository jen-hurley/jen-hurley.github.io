      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3> 
        <p class="blog-post">
          -   I didn't know that it would be so difficult for meto call upong my usual coping mechanisms for dealing with stress in the context of studying! I learnt that under this new circumstance I struggled to apply my abilities to take care of myself which was really interesting to me. <br><br>
          -   I saw very obvious examples of how stress and exhaustion can inhibit my ability to think and function logically/critically, and have learnt about how to recognise when things are becoming too much or when I'm not giving myself enough rest and care in the context of being a student. <br><br>
          -   That how I think of myself can be very different to how others view me, and I have learnt that I can shift my perspective of myself to see a more realistic and true reflection of my self image which will help a lot with my self confidence!<br><br>
        </p>


      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
        -   Values guide us in the direcetion we want to move towards in life. They encourage us to make good choices around our behaviour, thoughts, and actions. Knowing your values is important because they keep you connected to yourself, your intentions, and your beliefs. They help you to cultivate a sense of purpose, and self image which is very important for your mental wellbeing. <br><br>
        -   Empathy is incredibly important when it comes to interacting with others, but also the way in which we interact with ourselves. To work, communicate, and interact effectively you need empathy to help understand/communicate the needs of others and yourself. With the ability to understand your own and others feelings and responses, the needs of yourself and others can be correctly understood and met. It strenghtens your relationships with others and with yourself because it promotes collaboration, healthy relationships, and healthy responses to situations. It also helps us to communicate our ideas or needs in ways the make sense to others. <br><br>
        -   Self-awareness help us to better understand ourselves. When we understand ourselves, our strengths, and our weaknesses, we're able to build on that and make positive changes to develop ourselves. It can free us from our assumptions and biases so that we're better able to interact with ourselves and the world, and are better at facing challenges. It allows us to see ourselves from the perspective of others, have self-control, and gives us the ability to take pride in ourselves and our work so that we can increase our self-esteem.

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
        What surprised me was the depth to which I was able explore each topic. I was familar with each concept, but was given the opportunity and resources to explore them to a deeper level. It also reminded me of the importance of each of the topics and showed me how I can use them in the context of studying, as well as all other areas of my life. 
        </p>
    
      <h3>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p class="blog-post"> 
          The most challenging part was writing the blog posts! I coudl easily understand the topics and intergrate them into my life, but relaying my knowledge was a challenge for me. I'm glad that I got to practice that though, because I think that's also a very important thing to learn. 
          </p>
      
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p class="blog-post"> 
        Not at all! I enjoy learning about the core stuff just as much (if not more) than the tech side of the programme. Developing my core skills was something I was very excited about coming into Dev Academy.
