    <h2> NEUROPLASTICITY </h2>
    </div>
    <span></span>

      <h3>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people? </h3> 
        <p class="blog-post">
          Knowing that your brain is malleable gives people hope, motivation and self confidence in their ability to learn and develop new skills because they know that it IS possbile to grow and change your brain. 
          <br>
          <br>
          By understanding that you can adapt your brain through repetition when faced with something new or challenging fires up your neural pathways. When your neural pathways are activated they're ready to strength and making new connections which is the key to learning and problem solving. 
          <br>
          <br>
          When you believe that the brain is static then your brain avoids learning or solving the problem, and isn't open to creating those new pathways to learn. 
                  
</p>


      <h3>How I'll engage with the principles of neuroplasticity:</h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
          -   Remember that my brain is squishy and maluable and it has the potential to be squished and molded and grown by everything around it! 
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Use repetition by doing and researching to make the pathways stronger, and know that any pathways that aren't regularly used will be deleted/tidied up by my brain (even THINKING about practising something helps to build pathways!)
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Use Context to build pathways to make new or stronger connections. Using pathways my brain already knows it makes learning the new thing easier because most of the connection is already in place. 
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Acknowledge what the development means to me, and appreciate it's importance. 
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Be consistant with and committed to learning: how, when, for how long, how often.
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Reflecting what I've learned/experienced and questioning it to reinforce the new knowledge and develop a deeper understanding.
                  
</p>
        
      
      <h3>Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity are:</h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
          -   Look after your brain - give it good food, water, rest and psychical exercise so that it's primed to develop. 
          <br>
          <br>
          -   For the same reason as above, you also need to take care of your emotional wellbeing by limiting stress and being mindful/present.
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Having context when learning, so that the new skill has a path to travel down and then strengthen.
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Knowing and being receptive about the concept of neuroplasticity
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Commiting to developing
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Enrich your enviroment with things for it to learn and develop with like: a new language or instrument, travelling/exploring, making art, read. 
          <br>
          <br>
          -   Play! Playing video games or board games etc helps you grow your brain while having fun  - meaning it'll be more receptive to approaching and finding solutions to challenges.

    <h2> GROWTH MINDSET </h2>
    </div>
    <span></span>

      <h3>What's Growth Mindset and how is it useful? </h3> 
        <p class="blog-post">
          Growth mindset is the understanding that the brain IS neuroplastic - and that with effort, good teaching, and persistence you can develop/learn new skills. The priority is on learning, rather than the binary trap of achievemnt vs failure.
          <br>
          <br>
          Having a growth mindset increases brain activity when you're confronted with a problem, which allows it to strengthen and form new neurological connections, priming you for learning and finding solutions. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We're often taught that not achieving something is scary and bad because it exposes our imperfections, when really it's through failure, effort, and challenge that we can learn about and develop those flaws. 
          <br>
          <br>
          It changes the definition, significance, and impact of "failure" because it views failure as an oportunity to learn, rather than as something to be ashamed of. With a growth mindset you view failure as a sign to put in more effort rather than a reflection of never being able to achieve. 
          <br>
          <br>
          When you apporach failure with the fixed mindset of "I'm not good at this" (as opposed to "I'm not good at this YET"), you're promoting a stop to your developement and discouraging resilience and effort to keep trying. 

          FIXED MINDSET VS GROWTH MINDSET
          Do the easy thing bc you want to LOOK smart : Do the challenging thing because you want to GET smart.
          Hunger for approval : Passion for learning
          Aims to validate self : Aims to develop self
          I'm not good at this : I'm not good at this YET
          Praises ability : Praises effort  
          Success is achieving more than others : Success is developement and effort
          Challenge is scary : Challenge is fun!
          Ignores and discredits critisism : Is receptive to and uses critisism to improve

</p>


      <h3>What changed for me during this exploration? </h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
          I noticed more of the places where I have a fixed mindset. I'm really happy to have been prompted to spot them, because each time I find those tricky fixed mindsets, I can take a step back and question my approach from a new perspective. 
</p>
        
      
      <h3>How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
          -     Use "not yet" and view my developement as my marker for success. 
          <br>
          <br>
          -     Don't avoid challenge, and refame failure as an oportunity to learn.
          <br>
          <br>
          -     Though I get a lot of self esteem from figuring things out on my own, don't be affraid to ask for help.
          <br>
          <br>
          -     Continue to remind myself that I have the capability to learn and grow.
          <br>
          <br>
          -     Focus on acknowledging and praising myself for my effort, as opposed to focusing on my ability. 
          <br>
          <br>
          -     Take really good care of my brain and appreciate it
          
        </p>
    
        <h3>Here's another reasource I found very informative and engaging: </h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
          I really like this chart by Carol Dweck that compares the two mindsets and shows the different thought patterns and outcomes - 
          <br>
          <br>
          <img scr="../../../images/Carol-Dweck-Two-Mindsetes.jpeg">
        </p>


        <h3> The influence these studies have had on my learning journey: </h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
          I want to put more emphasis on taking care of my brain. I can very easily get caught up in my joy of learning, but I need to rememeber to also give my brain good fuel and the space to rest so that it can perform at it's best. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Keep to my commitments to learning
          <br>
          <br>
          Work on spotting and changing my fixed mindsets and refer to Carol Dwecks chart above when I feel the fixed mindset urges coming on.
          <br>
          <br>
          Approach challenge and asking for help with my new perspectives
