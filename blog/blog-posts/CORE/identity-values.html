    <h3>A time when I ethically made the WRONG decision...</h3>

    <p class="blog-post">
      When I was younger I stole money from the tills at my work... At the time I had a drug addiction, and the severity of my mental health issues meant I could only work part-time, so I wasn't earning very much money.
      <br>
      <br>
      I knew it was wrong to steal, but I justified the decision to myself because the money was "extra" money in the till, as a result of someone working on the tills that day had giving the incorrect change back to a customer. And so, there was more money in the till than what the system said - and I was the only person who knew about it... 
      <br>
      <br>
      I never felt like I particularly deserved that money more than the other staff, but I was feeling desparate and oportunistic in the cloud of my mental health issues. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I knew that the right thing to do would have been to put that money in the cash-over flow box instead of in my sock, but I chose to act selfishly instead. 
      <br>
      <br>
      When I reflect on it I still feel the guilt and embarrasment of my actions because my decision acted so strongly against my values around honesty, trust and fairness. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If it's any redemption to myself, at the same workplace my friend and I would go through the left over food that the staff didn't want and offer it to the homeless people on our walk home.
      <br>
      <br>
      There was always an excess of food at the end of our shifts, more than the staff could consume, and if no-one took it home it was to be thrown in the bin. Throwing good food out felt very wrong to us knowing there were people who needed it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      So, I suppose there was an ethical decission made there too - between the loyalty to our jobs and compassion for others. My values around compassion out weighed my loyalty to that job.

    </p>


      <h3>How the people around me have helped shape my values:</h3>

      <p class="blog-post">
      Acceptance: of myself, of others, and of circumstance
      <br>
      <br>
      Freedom: genuine self-expression and open-mindedness
      <br>
      <br>
      Love and Respect: towards others and towards the environment
      <br>
      <br>
      Curiosity: through love of learning, self-development and exploration.
      </p>
      
    
      <h3>My strengths and how they will support me on my learning journey:</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
      <em><u>Honesty</u></em> - acting in a sincere/genuine way will help me in developing my social skills and in my self confidence. Taking responsibilty for my feelings and actions helps me engage with the course through my self accountability to learn and grow. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Humilty</u></em> - not regarding myself as better or more deserving than others which helps me develop my skills in working in a team. Having humilty I can continue to learn with the "not yet" attitude and recoginize the limitations of my knowledge, and look to and appreciate others for their insights.
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Perspective</u></em> - being able to look at problems or challenges with different perspectives will develop my problem-solving skills. Being able to use my perspective when providing feedback will help with my interpersonal skills. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Appreciation of Beauty & Excellence</u></em> - I can use my appreciation to form inspiration and motivation.
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Creativity</u></em> - thinking in a creative way will help me to conceptulize and do things in a novel way which will expand my receptivity to learning and exploring.
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Persiverance</u></em> - persisting with my learning and doing the course even when it gets tough. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Forgiveness</u></em> - will help me with my development in working in a team and how I relate to others. Understanding we're all going to have struggles at some point means I can forgive people for acting poorly under stress and therefore gives oportunaty to help them. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Social Intelligence</u></em> - in a similar way to the above, being able to understand and act on others feelings, thoughts and behaviour in an empathic way will help build my skills in working in a team and further my learning from others. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Kindness</u></em> - helps me to develop my inter-personal skills, and if I act with kindness towards myself it will lessen the oportunity for negative self-talk, stress or being too overwhlemed to hinder my learning. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><u>Hope</u></em> - having hope drives me to suceed in learning because it will reduce my feelings of self-doubt when I'm faced with challenge. By remaining hopeful I can continue to aspire towards my goals.
  </p>
      
      <h3>My limitations in terms of learning and career development, and how they might have an effect:</h3>
      
      <p class="blog-post">
      I'm on the Autistic Spectrum and suffer from Complex PTSD - and... to add to the mix... these come with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety disorders. 
      <br>
      <br>
      How these limit my learning and career development:
      <br>
      <br>
      <u><em>Attention and Concentration: </em></u>
      <br>
      <br>
      Hyperfixation; 
      <br>which can sometimes be really cool and fun, but makes me susceptible to burn-out and sometimes it affects how I prioritize my tasks.
      <br>
      <br>
      Attention Defict; 
      <br>sometimes it can be really difficult for me to hold my attention, and it can get very exhausting for me to do so.
      <br>
      <br>
      <u><em>Sociability and Communication:</em></u>
      <br>
      <br>
      Social anxiety; 
      <br>having a fear around social interactions
      <br>
      <br>
      Social Skills;
      <br>I'm lacking in social skills and ability to pick up on social cues, so I have some difficulties with communication and understanding concepts or situations. Generally, I prefer very direct communication/instruction to help me understand. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <u><em>Self Image:</em></u>
      <br>
      <br>
      Self-confidence; 
      <br> I lack confidence in myself and my abilities
      <br>
      <br>
      Self-esteem; 
      <br>I lack self-esteem which means it can be hard for me to motivate myself 
      <br>
      <br>
      <u><em>Emotional Regulation:</em></u>
      <br>
      <br>
      I can, at times, get easily overwhelmed, and it can be difficult for me to regulate my emotions. This means I have to take time aside to calm myself in order to carry on. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <u><em>Perfectionism:</em></u>
      <br>
      <br>
      I have tendencies towards perfectionism and being very self critical. This means I can find it hard to know when to stop because I don't know when it's "good enough" 
      <br>
      <br>
      ** Despite the long list, these are all areas I have been actively working on along-side my therapist who has helped me to develop healthy coping mechanisms and develop my skills.
        </p>
    
      <h3>An example of a time when there was resistence and tension with a collegue:</h3>
      
      <p class="blog-post">
      I had a difficult time training a new employee to take over my role. I had never trained anyone in a work environment before and my boss didn't make themself available to help me with the training. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The new employee was very disinterested in the position, because they only needed the job for supplimentary income while they were studying. Their disinterest made it difficult to train them becuase they rarely payed attention to what I was showing them which meant I had to continuily repeat myself. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I practiced my patience, and empathised that they might have had other things going on in their life that could have impacted their attention. 
      <br>
      <br>
      When I found myself getting frustrated, I took myself aside to take a deep breath and then calmly showed them again. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I also started asking them to repeat processes back to me so that I could see they understood, reminded them it was okay to ask me to explain further if they didn't understand, and also asked for them to give me feedback on how the training was going. 
      <br>
      <br>
      After incorporating the method of getting them to repeat the process back to me they became more engaged when I showed them new things. 
      <br>
      <br>
      However, the most difficult part was that they seemed to have an issue with me personally and would behave very disrespectfully towards me.
      <br>
      <br>
      At first I tried to assume they didn't mean any offence or it was a misunderstanding, and I would step outside to calm down and try to assess the situation aside from my emotions. 
      <br>
      <br>
      But, over time their behaviour grew more agressive and offensive to the point where I was trying to avoid them and I was often having to go outside to cry. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I decided to talk to my collegue to ask for their advice on how to deal with the situation. They suggested I be more assertive and stand up for myself, but due to my fear of conflict I decided to continue to try to ignore their behaviour - plus being able to appropriately vent about it helped take some of the pressure off for me. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The next day I asked my boss to meet with me so that my boss and I could discuss how to approach the situation. 
      <br>
      <br>
      My boss shead some light on possible reasons for their behaviour that I hadn't thought of, one being that culturally the new employee might have an issue with being trained by someone younger than them and that they we're expressing that by acting disrespectfully towards me. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Having a deeper understanding of why they might have been acting that way helped me to not lock-up so much when they offended me, and instead I was able to re-access my emapthic approach. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I tried then instead to react kindly and relaxed towards their behaviour. Their behaviour began to soften towards me, and I think that's because I remained professional and tried to emphasize to them that the job/workspace was respectful and relaxed, which might have been what disarmed them. 
      <br>
      <br>
      There were probably times during that situation where I could have appropriately been more assertive. Though, in this situation, it didn't feel very necessary because correcting their behaviour towards me wasn't actually entirely my responsibilty to correct their behaviour - since I was the only one they seemed to have an issue with and I was going to be leaving the company.
