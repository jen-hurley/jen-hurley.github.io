          <h2> Mindfulness </h2>
          
            <h3>Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?</h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            Before I was introduced to mindfulness a couple of years ago I did have biasis against it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn't see the point and it made me very uncomfortable because it was a feeling I wasn't used to. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My therapist was one of the first people to teach me about the importance of mindfulness and it has helped greatly with my PTSD symptoms, like disassosiating. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I began using mindfulness as a coping mechanism for my panic attacks and flashbacks, and seeing how it helped me come back to the present and calm down during those situations made me trust it's importance in all other areas of my life. 
          </p>
      
            <h3>How did you find the overall experience? </h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            Loved it. I do yoga daily so I'm familiar with the concept of listening to breath and bodily sensations, but I often find it more difficult to be mindful when I'm not moving through poses. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I find it easier to stage engaed when I'm having to pay attention to which poses I'm being instructed to do. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Guided meditations will be good for me to start becuase I'll have another voice guiding me through the session. When I try to do it on my own at the moment I get very fidgity and distracted, but I'm sure that with practise I'll be able to improve those skills and be able to meditate on my own without guidence. 
            
          </p>

          <h3>What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? </h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            At a minimum I'd like to do the 5 min breath mindfulness before I start working each day and do the body scan as I'm getting ready for sleep at night. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I'd also like to try to remember to incorporate the 5 min breath excercise after I come back to work from my longer/lunch break.

          <h2>Listening and Looping </h2>
          
            <h3>What was it like to be fully listened to? </h3>
            <p class="blog-post">
              It actually made me feel a bit apprehensive! I don't often get to experience feeling like I'm being fully listened or that I'm being fully understood. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I'm used to the feeling of not being listened to from young age, partly because a lot of the people around me are neuro-diveragent, so it never bothered me too much because that's all I knew. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Experiencing the oposite felt very unfamilar and almost "bad" because I don't feel like I deserve anyone's attention. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I'd like to get comfortable with the feeling that what I express/say is acknowledged, valued and respected. 
          </p>

            <h3>What was it like to fully listen?</h3>
            <p class="blog-post">
              GREAT! I felt less socially anxious because I was paying attention to what they were saying more than I was paying attention to my anxieties or distractions. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I had to remain engaged and remember what they were saying by repeating in my head what they were saying to me. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I found when I was relaying what they said back through the looping portion I was able to process what they said more deeply as well. The processing part is something I struggle with sometimes as it can take a while for my brain to process/understand what people are saying, so repeating it back helped me to do the processing and understanding part without feeling the immediate pressure that I needed to do that at the same time as I was listening. 
              </p>

              <h2> Intro to JavaScript </h2>

            <h3>What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?</h3>
              <p class="blog-post">
                That was such a cool way to do challenges! Learning by doing really works for me, and having to do a little bit of extra digging around for info for some of the challenges was also really beneficial for me to learn how to find what i'm looking for. 
                </p>
            
              <h3>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?</h3>
              <p class="blog-post">
                I did! I'm more comfortable with the idea that I don't need to retain all this info right now, and that with more practise i'll retain it - as oppossed to trying to rote learn it all now. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, I probably spend a bit longer than I should have trying to figure out the stretch questions. I'm going to leave them for now and come back at the end of the sprint (if i have time). I might understand it more after I finish the rest of this weeks work. 
                </p>
                </div>

<div class="about-me-post">
                    <h2> JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along</h2>
              <h3>How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    Yes, it's cool to see how much you can do in JS and how little HTML you need to do it! It was fun! It helped me tie all the JS knowledge together. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After this exercise the previous challenges make more sense, and I want to go back a try the stretch q's now for Loops and for JS Cafe too (if I have time/am not too tired)
                </p>

                <h3>What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    Loops - this activity made loops make sense to me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Realised how much you can do in JS with such a minimal amount of HTML, basically how POWERFUL and useful JS is. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was cool to notice how much I had retained from the previous challenges even though at the time of doing the previous ones I didn't feel like I was retaining much info at all. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Making notes as comments in the code about what each part does was handy for me. previously I was mainly writing things out in a separate doc or piece of paper. but now I have all my notes in the doc to go back to and look over later.
