          <h2> Your Blog </h2>
          
            <h3>Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            Inside the folder/directory where my Github repo for my Blog is saved I created another directory for my blog and created a .html file in there. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I opened that .html file in Visual Studio Code and pasted the html template that was provided and saved the file.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then I commited the file to my Github repo by adding/staging, commiting, and then pushing it to my remote repo on Github. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For adding the .css file it was the same process. I made a separate folder inside the blog directory in my repo for my style sheets. I created a file called main.css and opened it in VS Code.
            <br>
            <br>
            I then went back to the .html file and changed the link to my stylesheet to be the path to my main.css file then saved the file. I then made another push to Github with the changes of adding the new link to my main.css style sheet, and also separately pushed the main.css file up as it's initial commit.

            <h3>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            Better today! I'm keeping in the suggested time, and actually faster since I've studied some HTML and CSS before so I'm familiar with using VS Code in that sense. I also found navigating through the terminal and the Git process more effortless. I feel like I'm working a lot faster this week.

            <h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</h3>
            <p class="blog-post">
            Self-doubt, and feeling overwhelmed and directionless. I felt like I had all this new information I'd learnt, but did know where to begin in applying it! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I talked my frustrations out with my partner and since it was already quite late at night I went to sleep. When I woke up the next day I felt a lot better because I felt like the information had been sorted out in my brain while I was asleep. I then had the confidence to break it down into steps and just start with the very basics. That started me on a roll, because once I could see my competencies I had a better idea about what I wanted to do.

            <h3>What are of you proud of from this challenge?</h3>
            <p class="blog-post">
              Pushing through and breaking my learning down into chunks!! When I started today I was feeling very overwhelmed by all the posibilities and didn't know where to begin.

            <h3>What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?</h3>
              <p class="blog-post">
                Being able to play and explore along side tutorials helps me stay engaged while I'm learning. 
                </p>
            
              <h3>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</h3>
              <p class="blog-post">
                Just things like terminology e.g Bootstrap and DOM. But I just paused the tutorial and googled what they meant.

              <h3>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</h3>

                  13... 2 are non-study ones, and 6 are pinned tabs.

                    <h2> Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge </h2>
              <h3>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  </h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    Once upon a time there was a sculpter, named HTML. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    HTML could build very structurally sound sculptures, but HTML never really got into styling and was limited just a few basics like colour and size when it came to applying any style to his art. His sculptures always lacked the pazzaz he knew his audience wanted.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, he meet a girl named CSS. She was VERY stylish and knew everything there was to know about style. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    CSS really wanted something to apply her styling abilities to, but she could never make anything with structure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    HTML and CSS realised they could link up and start making sculptures TOGETHER! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so they did, and they produced very beautiful sculptures that we're both super STYLISH and STRUCTURAL.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The End.
                </p>
                <h3>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    I learnt it is helpful for me to hand write notes, but that I can be selective about which notes to write instead of EVERYTHING. Whenever I was confused I would Google the issue and find an explaination that made more sense to me. If i was blocked it was usually a typo on my part. 
                </p>
                <h3>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    Hand write the squences in my notebook. I got put off handwritting notes today because I thought it might be a waste of my time, but I do know it helps me stay engaged and retain info.
                </p>
                

            <h3>Any moments of surprise or joy? </h3>
                <p class="blog-post">
                  Yes! When I realized my capabilities when I could apply the technical skills I learnt, and also the inspiration and motivation I gained through learning and exploring.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I've also been surprised by how difficult is is for me to ask my peers/facilitators for help... I'm someone who usually likes to solve problems on their own, but I've now learnt I'll waste A LOT of time doing that.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  And I've been struggling with getting hyperfixated on particular parts (i.e. making my blog) and forgetting to take breaks. I'm going to be more solid with my study plan next week - I think I'm still trying to find the right balance around it.

                <h3>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why? </h3>
                <p class="blog-post">
                  HTML: Coral
                  <br>
                  CSS: Algae
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Coral is the structure that the algae needs to be able to survive. The Algae photosynthesizes to give the coral energy and bright colors.

        <h2> Branch, Pull, Merge</h2>
  <h3>What is main?</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
       The main is the master (and ideally fully working) version of the project
      </p>

      <h3>Why create a Branch?</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        Branches are for testing out new features/code before including it in the main version without effecting the main. This means you can also have your feature/new code reviewed before merging it to the main incase there are errors in your code, so that you don't accidentally break the main. 

      </p>

      <h3>Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand? </h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        Inituitive
      </p>

<div class="about-me-post">
  <h2> GitHub Fork & Clone</h2>
    <h3>What are some examples of when you would fork?</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
      You would fork a project that belongs to someone else that you don't have permissions to alter or add to, meaning that you could try some stuff out without altering anything in the main repository and then propose it to the author who can decide whether or not they want to include it in the main.   
      </p> 

    <h3>Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked? </h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
    Yes! It click when I understood the purpose of forking as opposed to branching, particularily when it comes to open source projects. 
    </p>

</div>

<div class="about-me-post">
  <h2> Setup Repo & Create Blog</h2>
    <h3>Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        I felt a little nervous about branching. I wanted to REALLY make sure I didn't override anything on the main. If anything, it felt a bit overhwleming having to do all the stages of Git, but I understand the necessity of them.
      </p> 

    <h3>If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions? </h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
    Coming from a background in administration I imagined that people would just use a Dropbox equivalent for working on projects. I imagined the work all to be done in one place that people could collabrorate one, like GoogleDocs.

  <h2> Thinking like a programmer</h2>
    <h3>What is your process so far for solving problems?</h3>
    <ul class="blog-post">
      <li>Figure out exactly what it is that need to be achieved. </li>
      <li>Break it down into separate parts or steps.</li>
      <li>Understand each part of the problem and research the problem areas to get a deeper understanding of what's going on. </li>
      <li>Make a plan on how to work through each part.</li>
      <li>Work on each part until it's resolved.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Have a look at what the internet says on how to think like a programmer. What patterns do you see? What do you notice? </h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
      To think like a programmer is to have the ability to effeciently solve problems by breaking them down and looking at them from different perspectives to find solutions. It's about approaching problems in a logical manner. I notice a lot of amphasis on persistence and taking a step back when you get overwhelmed, so that you can come back to the problem from a calmer place. I think having this ability is useful in all areas of life. It's a mindset that's based on growth and persiverance.
    </p>

    <h3>What does the internet say about flipped learning? What is flipped learning and flipped classroom? How do you think it will relate to your learning journey?</h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Flipped Classroom is when students are provide the course information/materials to be studied outside of the classroom which leaves class time available for applied learning of the course materials and teacher assistance. I think it is going to be particularly helpful for me to be able to go back over information as often as I need in my own time to be able to understand the concept. The flexibility around when and how the course material is learnt is a lot more accessible to me when the basic learning is pre-provided outside of class and then used in a pratical sense during assignments.

      <h2> Introduce yourself</h2>
        <h3> What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? </h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            SCARY! But I'm glad I did it because I want to develop my self confidence, and it's great that I get to practice doing that in an environment where I feel safer and my comfortable than I usually would. 
          </p> 
    
        <h3>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?  </h3>
        <p class="blog-post">
          I was very self conscious! I don't like much attention or talking about myself, so it's something I wouldn't really do on my own accord.
