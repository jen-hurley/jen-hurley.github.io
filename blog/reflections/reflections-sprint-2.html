          <h2> Your Blog </h2>
          
            <h3>Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            Inside the folder/directory where my Github repo for my Blog is saved I created another directory for my blog and created a .html file in there. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I opened that .html file in Visual Studio Code and pasted the html template that was provided and saved the file.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then I commited the file to my Github repo by adding/staging, commiting, and then pushing it to my remote repo on Github. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For adding the .css file it was the same process. I made a separate folder inside the blog directory in my repo for my style sheets. I created a file called main.css and opened it in VS Code.
            <br>
            <br>
            I then went back to the .html file and changed the link to my stylesheet to be the path to my main.css file then saved the file. I then made another push to Github with the changes of adding the new link to my main.css style sheet, and also separately pushed the main.css file up as it's initial commit.

            <h3>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</h3>
          <p class="blog-post">
            Better today! I'm keeping in the suggested time, and actually faster since I've studied some HTML and CSS before so I'm familiar with using VS Code in that sense. I also found navigating through the terminal and the Git process more effortless. I feel like I'm working a lot faster this week.

            <h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</h3>
            <p class="blog-post">
            Self-doubt, and feeling overwhelmed and directionless. I felt like I had all this new information I'd learnt, but did know where to begin in applying it! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I talked my frustrations out with my partner and since it was already quite late at night I went to sleep. When I woke up the next day I felt a lot better because I felt like the information had been sorted out in my brain while I was asleep. I then had the confidence to break it down into steps and just start with the very basics. That started me on a roll, because once I could see my competencies I had a better idea about what I wanted to do.

            <p class="blog-post">
              Pushing through and breaking my learning down into chunks!! When I started today I was feeling very overwhelmed by all the posibilities and didn't know where to begin.

                Being able to play and explore along side tutorials helps me stay engaged while I'm learning.

              <h3>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</h3>
              <p class="blog-post">
                Just things like terminology e.g Bootstrap and DOM. But I just paused the tutorial and googled what they meant.

                  13... 2 are non-study ones, and 6 are pinned tabs.

                    <h2> Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge </h2>
              <h3>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  </h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    Once upon a time there was a sculpter, named HTML. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    HTML could build very structurally sound sculptures, but HTML never really got into styling and was limited just a few basics like colour and size when it came to applying any style to his art. His sculptures always lacked the pazzaz he knew his audience wanted.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, he meet a girl named CSS. She was VERY stylish and knew everything there was to know about style. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    CSS really wanted something to apply her styling abilities to, but she could never make anything with structure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    HTML and CSS realised they could link up and start making sculptures TOGETHER! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so they did, and they produced very beautiful sculptures that we're both super STYLISH and STRUCTURAL.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The End.
                </p>
                <h3>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    I learnt it is helpful for me to hand write notes, but that I can be selective about which notes to write instead of EVERYTHING. Whenever I was confused I would Google the issue and find an explaination that made more sense to me. If i was blocked it was usually a typo on my part. 
                </p>
                <h3>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post">
                    Hand write the squences in my notebook. I got put off handwritting notes today because I thought it might be a waste of my time, but I do know it helps me stay engaged and retain info.
                </p>
                

            <h3>Any moments of surprise or joy? </h3>
                <p class="blog-post">
                  Yes! When I realized my capabilities when I could apply the technical skills I learnt, and also the inspiration and motivation I gained through learning and exploring.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I've also been surprised by how difficult is is for me to ask my peers/facilitators for help... I'm someone who usually likes to solve problems on their own, but I've now learnt I'll waste A LOT of time doing that.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  And I've been struggling with getting hyperfixated on particular parts (i.e. making my blog) and forgetting to take breaks. I'm going to be more solid with my study plan next week - I think I'm still trying to find the right balance around it. 
                
                </p>

                <h3>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why? </h3>
                <p class="blog-post">
                  HTML: Coral
                  <br>
                  CSS: Algae
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Coral is the structure that the algae needs to be able to survive. The Algae photosynthesizes to give the coral energy and bright colors.
